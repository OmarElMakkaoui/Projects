code Cvoid.py: Implements a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to predict NO₂ concentrations based on meteorological variables. The model captures non-linear relationships using smoothing splines and helps in weather normalization.

code theil senrenud.py: Uses Theil-Sen regression to estimate trends in residual NO₂ concentrations after weather normalization. This method provides a robust estimation of the long-term impact of human activities on pollution levels.
